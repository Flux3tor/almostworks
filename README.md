# AlmostWorks

This site almost works.
That's the problem.

AlmostWorks is a fake submission form that looks like it's job, but quietly sabotages you the whole time. The button runs away, the inputs forget what you typed, and the progress bar has no idea what progess even is.

Nothing is technically "broken".
Everything is just... wrong.

I built this for the  **Borked UI Jam** to see how far you can push a website before it becomes unusable, even though it still technically works.

## What happens here
You try to submit a form.
The website tries to stop you.
That's the whole experience.

## Stuff it does
- The submit button dodges your mouse
- Text boxes randomly clar themselves
- The loading bar resets when it's almost done
- Success messages don't mean success

## Why I made this
Bad UI is way more memorable than good UI.
This is a tribute to every website that made you say
"bro this almost works... but it doesn't"

## Built with
HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
No frameworks. Just bad decisions.
